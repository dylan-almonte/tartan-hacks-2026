# NudgePay Extension

Chrome extension that monitors checkout pages on Amazon and Uber Eats and compares your cart total against your budget.

## Installation

1. Open `chrome://extensions/` in Chrome
2. Enable **Developer mode** (top-right toggle)
3. Click **Load unpacked** and select this `extension/` folder
4. Copy the assigned **Extension ID** into `website/config.js` as the `EXTENSION_ID` value

## How it works

- **Content scripts** (`amazon.js`, `ubereats.js`) detect order totals on checkout pages
- **Service worker** (`background.js`) stores budget data and communicates with the Nessie API
- **Popup** (`popup.html`) shows your detected cart total vs. remaining budget

## Connecting to the dashboard

1. Start the website dashboard and log in
2. Click **"Send to Extension"** on the dashboard to sync your budget data
3. If you change the dashboard URL from `localhost`, update `externally_connectable` in `manifest.json`
